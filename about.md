Hi! I’m Anqi (pronounced An-chee). I’m a full-stack scholar working on AI in communication, with research spanning human–AI interaction and public engagement with contested science and technology topics (including AI itself, of course).

I earned my PhD in Science Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2025, and I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher for [Waterbot](https://azwaterbot.org) at Arizona State University. My work sits at the intersection of system building and empirical research, with a focus on how people interact with AI and how AI-mediated communication shapes understanding of contested topics in public life. 

One strand of my research examines AI hallucinations (plausible yet inaccurate AI outputs) and what happens after people encounter them. I map how they look like for contested topics. I also study how users revise beliefs, adjust trust, and change information-seeking behavior once errors become visible. To some extent, [my dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3251610603?sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses) work is basically a collection of my current empirical research toolkit.

I also work on AI as a public-facing communicator, including conversational systems used in crisis response, science education, and policy-relevant settings. This line of work looks at interaction design, user experience, and how communication choices shape engagement over time. All stories start with [this piece](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51969-w).

My teaching experience spans multiple communication courses, where I learned how to translate research concepts into classroom activities and engage students with different backgrounds and skill levels, to equip them for real world challenges. My most recent [guest lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x7-f9ATToOYFdhR829oqCM_wqiA8sorT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107697692803502831972&rtpof=true&sd=true) was on working with unstructured user data (chatlogs), with a hands-on practice activity in AI-assisted content analysis with human-in-the-loop.
