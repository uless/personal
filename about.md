Hi! I'm Anqi, a PhD candidate from University of Wisconsin - Madison, Department of Life Sciences Communication.

My name is pronounced as /An CHEE/. It means angel in Mandarin Chinese. 

I currently work in SciLab with Dr. Dietram Scheufele, Dr. Dominique Brossard and other colleagues as part of my doctoral program. My research broadly involves using computational and other quantitative methods upon public opinion on controversial science issues.

One of my representative work (with Dr. Kaiping Chen) during my doctoral program is [this piece](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51969-w) about human-chatbot interaction over controversial topics. I proudly presented & practiced my skills in survey design and launch*, statistics, and computational text analysis in this project.

My dissertation focus on the changing science information ecosystem with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). On the supply side, what we have been referring to as "science misinformation" may not actually be misinformation, and I discuss the reliability of scientific information becoming a concerning issue with GenAI hallucination. On the demand side, I assess why and how people's ways of scientific knowing and perceptions may be altered by GenAI, if at all.

For more information, please check out my recent CV:

Not included in CV: My love and as a noob for ARPG (mainly souls/souls-like) and FPS games; My cat D.Va (she's now 5); My collection of tea, coffee, and craft beers (lagers only, sorry).

*There are plenty of flaws in this study design seeing from 3 years later, but I regard it as a good practice.
